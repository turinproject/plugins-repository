Crystal structures of over 500 common materials, elements, oxides, including:

* All elements
* Common oxides (SiO2, CaO, etc.)
* Common halides (NaCl, etc.)
* Ice
* Zeolites
* Silicates, Carbonates, etc.
* Sulfides, Selenides, Tellurides (e.g., ZnS, etc.)
* Nitrides, Phosphides, Arsenides (e.g., GaAs, InP, etc.)

All files are available in the public domain, although most include citation information
for the original structure.

All Zeolites are available from the [International Zeolite Association (IZA)
Structure Commission](https://www.iza-structure.org/databases/).

All other crystal structures are available through the [Crystallographic Open
Database](https://crystallography.net/cod/).
