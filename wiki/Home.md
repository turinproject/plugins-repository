# Abstract

Software development has become increasingly more modular and collaborative. Smaller scientific software teams can greatly benefit from the advancement of collaborative development approaches to help extend their already long lifespans. A scientific project's lifespan will often be passed down to many maintainers, each building their own extensions of the original software's purpose. Without the benefit of large team sizes seen in today's software development practices, creating and maintaining a list of ways in which a specific piece of software can be used can be a chore many scientific groups don't have the luxury to implement.

This project aims to simplify this process by utilizing GitHub as the code repository, data store and web host. This benefits smaller scientific teams as they can easily keep a record of ways in which their project has been used with out the overhead of maintaining multiple hosting platforms for code, persistent data and web services.

To accomplish this we use GatsbyJS, Github, GraphQL & Netlify CMS to create our all-in one plugin repository for your software application.
