# Turin Project Plugins Repository

A GatsbyJS, Github, GraphQL & Netlify CMS all-in one plugin repository for your software application.

This project use uses markdown, static site generation, GraphQL and git to create a statically served CMS for software application plugins.

This framework was initially built as a repository store for the [Avogadro 2 Plugin Repository](https://plugins.avogadro.cc/) but can easily be extended as a plugin repository for any public GitHub hosted plugin repository for any software application or framework.

This plugin repository was initially funded by the [U.S. National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/)<sup>1</sup>. Portions of this README address the thought behind the creation of this application with the hopes of it being of use to the FOSS and Scientific Communities in helping them extend their own community driven applications.

* `npm install`
* `npm run start` For development
* `npm run build` For production build.
